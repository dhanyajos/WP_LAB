<p><i><b>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.
 Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. 
Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.</b></i>
