<p><i>Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. 
Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds. 
Flowers may grow separately on the plant, or they may grow together in an inflorescence.</i>

<p>Flowers' importance in nature is everywhereâ€”they can feed insects, birds, animals and humans; 
provide natural medicines for humans and some animals; and aid in a plant's reproduction by enticing outside pollinators. 
Without flowers, plants would merely be green, and the world would be a duller place.
